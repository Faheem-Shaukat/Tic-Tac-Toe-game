# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and interactive 2-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, two players take turns marking the boxes with X and O. The first player to match 3 symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game. If all boxes are filled and no player wins, the match is declared a Draw.
